# 🌾 Crop Recommender System

This is my **first project**, created during the **3rd semester** of my B.Tech in Data Science & AI. It’s a basic crop recommendation system that suggests the best crop to grow based on inputs like soil type, temperature, rainfall, and humidity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (for frontend logic)
- Tkinter (GUI)
- C++ (for backend processing)
- Subprocess integration

---

## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly GUI to input environmental parameters
- Backend logic in C++ for speed
- ML model (simple logic-based in this version)
- Can be improved and expanded easily

---

## 📈 Future Plans

I'm planning to build an upgraded version with:
- Real-time weather APIs
- More accurate ML models (Random Forest/XGBoost)
- Flask web UI or mobile integration
- Better backend logic
- Soil DB support

## 📌 Personal Note

This project was a great learning experience — combining Python and C++ with real-world applications. I’ll continue refining this as I grow as a developer.
